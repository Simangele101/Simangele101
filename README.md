### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Simangele101/Simangele101/master/wave.gif" width="40px">
My Name is **Simangele Maphanga**,I am an aspiring Data scientist with a love data modelling,data exploration and data visualization and pipelining.With A Background in Human Resources,from Tshwane University of Technology, Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa. I decided to upskill my HR skillset with data science and data analytics.I am Currently Undergoing Data science training at [Explore Data Science Academy](https://explore-datascience.net/) and have Startd my Data science Internship with Old Mutual SA (Pty) Ltd. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simangele-maphanga/)

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on HR analytics attrition project

The Current Project I am working on involves A large company named XYZ,  that employs, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. However, every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market. The management believes that this level of attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company, because of the following reasons -

The former employeesâ€™ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, resulting in a reputation loss among consumers and partners
A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of recruiting new talent
More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and/or given time to acclimatise themselves to the company
Hence, the management has contracted an HR analytics firm to understand what factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition. In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay. Also, they want to know which of these variables is most important and needs to be addressed right away.
The Repository to this project will be updated soon....

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL, Alteryx and Tableau
Since Starting at Old Mutual South Africa (Pty) Ltd, I have been learning a lot of new tools that make data analytics, Visualization and data modelling easier for a data scientist and Mostly I have been working on SQL for retrieving, Alteryx for data wrangling and Tableau for Data visualization. I am really excited to see what the next phase will be and the tools that will be used.
